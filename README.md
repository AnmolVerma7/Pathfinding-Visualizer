## Description
This Python script, `PathfindingVisualizer.py`, provides a visual implementation of 2 pathfinding algorithms using Pygame. It's designed to visually demonstrate the most efficient path between two points in a 50x50 grid (but this can be changed in the code). The script allows users to interact with the grid, place start and end points, and visualize the pathfinding process in real time.

## Installation
To run this script, you'll need Python and Pygame. If you don't have Pygame installed, you can install it via pip: `pip install pygame`

## Usage
Run the script with the following command: `PathfindingVisualizer.py`

Once the window opens, you can interact with the grid to set start and end points, as well as obstacles, and then watch the A* algorithm in action.

## Controls
- **Left Mouse Click**: Set the start point, end point, and draw obstacles.
- **Right Mouse Click**: Remove nodes or obstacles.
- **Spacebar**: Start the algorithm.
- **C**: Clear the grid.
- **A**: A* Pathfinding Algorithm
- **B**: Dijkstras Pathfinding Algorithm
